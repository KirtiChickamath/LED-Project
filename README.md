# LED-Project

## Project Details

**Project Name:** LED Project 

**Software Used:** Altium

**Credits:** This board design is based on the course **“Starting with Altium”** by [Robert Feranec](https://www.udemy.com/course/starting-with-altium-designer/)  
This version was recreated as part of personal practice and learning.

This simple board lights up two LEDs using 360Ohms current limiting resistors and 3.3V DC input supply. It was designed fpr practicing schematic capture, PCB layout and documentation using Altium Designer.

### Versions:
**1.All components fitted** : It includes both LED1 and LED2 and their corresponding current limiting resistors.
**2.LED2 not fitted** : R2 and LED2 are not assembled.
